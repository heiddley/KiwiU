	<p>				Kiwi Union’s foundations

	<br><br>
	<div style="padding:200px;">
	To the Public, 

	For most, concerns have developed over the direction Governments have taken, both previous and current, nationally and globally. It is fair to suggest an earning from society the world over to a new approach of representation, one not too extravagant, too outrageous but sufficient in shifts to accommodate changes in the direction society want to go. This would have to accommodate more informed representation with clear goals and processes to their nation’s prospects. 
	It is with this interest the NZ Kiwi Union Political Party has been created. 
	</p>
	<p>Kiwi Union is a new political movement in the interests of providing a more informed, greater participation and longer term representation while taking directives from the voter/constituent. 
	It is viewed by K.U that western politics are in a class war where social ideas, practices and morals are under attack by the capitalist elite class.
	Where documents like the Bill of Rights and Te Tiriti are under threat and campaigned as divisive, destructive, and immoral. Accusations such as hate, racism and difference are tools to provoke and allow coercive suppression against groups of society. At K. U. we believe the role is to bring together the similarities while working through the differences in the pursuit of returning our moral compass.
	</p>
	<p>K.U. wishes to focus on 3 social groups, the Working Class, the Consumer and the Citizen. These groups belong to the foundation of which allows KU to establish reforms in four areas Social, Political, Economic and Legal.
	It is our primary focus to elevate Social Philosophy in order to create sound Public Policy that provides sufficient environments to ascend Social Philosophy, enhancing Public Policy, creating environments to elevate Philosophy…
	The closed circuit of social development, that once initiated, propagates itself into a perpetual cycle.
	The Legal reform is reflective in development of previous stated reforms and plans to determine, in accordance to the three social groups union, an elevated status of the ‘Human’ then that of the commercial entity, in addition by also placing responsibility upon the agitator then that of the recipient.
	</p><p>
	The intrinsic process of the perpetual cycle is in the reform of the Economic system, in Monetary Policy, Fiscal Policy and Foreign Trade. 
	K.U is an advocate of MMT and plans to manage the economy through this lens.
	The productive economy referred to as the Real Economy is a primary focus creating high employment, consumer spending, home acquisition and social development.
